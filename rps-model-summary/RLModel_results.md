## Human performance: benchmark

**The above visualization demonstrates how human participants performed against bots which possessed unique strategies. The red dotted baseline indicates that the wining rate would be 33% if the participant did not exploit the perceivable patterns. The wining rate converges to the chance line as pattern of each bot becomes more complicated.**
